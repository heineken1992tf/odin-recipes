    <h1>Vegan lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.png" alt="lasagna">
    <p>These are truly my favorite lasagna recipe to make at home. The filling is anything but boring, and the ingredients are super simple and mostly pantry staples. Plus, they are freezer friendly! So make a double batch and have delicious burritos ready any time you get a burrito craving. No one will miss the meat in these mouthwatering vegetarian burritos. 

        <br><br>
        
        
    Serve with the toppings of your choice, like vegan sour cream, shreddable vegan cheese (make your own or use something like daiya shreds), lettuce, chopped tomato and more.Who could say no to a delicious burrito? Definitely not me. Especially if it’s this easy to make! I love buying vegan burritos or burrito bowls, but you can also easily make them at home. THey are also super fun to make with friends. Just divide the preparation of the different ingredients for the filling between some people and you’ll be done really quickly. </p>
